### Summary:
The `netlify.toml` file is a configuration file for Netlify that specifies settings for building and deploying a site. It includes build settings like the directory to publish (`dist`) and the command to run (`npm run build`). The redirects section manages URL redirects, ensuring that all routes (`/*`) are redirected to the single-page application entry point (`/index.html`) with a 200 status code. This is crucial for client-side routing in single-page applications, ensuring proper handling of all paths by the front-end application.

TOML stands for "Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language." It is a configuration file format that aims to be easy to read and write due to its simple syntax and structure. TOML files are commonly used for application configuration and can be parsed into a data structure that applications can use to configure themselves.
